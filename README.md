# Memory Game

## Summary

<<<<<<< HEAD
Memory game is a type of classical memory card game which I've done as a part of Front-end Developer course

How to play the game
You need to choose the difficulty level first - 1 is easy, 2 is medium and 3 is hard. It will lead you to the game itself. Your task is to remember all the pairs of card in 5 seconds, because after that it will be flipped and timer wil start. If you choose all pairs correct you win, but if you make a mistake - you loose, so pay attention!
After you finish the game, you can plan it again on a different leave or same one, up to you

Installation
